# portfoliov2

A simple, modern portfolio for a software developer built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

The home page showcases experience, projects, education, skills, and contact details with subtle scroll-triggered animations.

## Development

- `npm ci` – install dependencies

- `npm run dev` – start the development server
- `npm run build` – build the application for production
- `npm start` – start the production server

The project structure is intentionally minimal and easy to expand with additional pages or components.
